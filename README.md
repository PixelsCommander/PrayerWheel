### Karma Wheel

According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, a prayer wheel produces positive karma when spinning, blessing all sentinel beings around and most of all the one who spins. Based on the lineage texts regarding prayer wheels, spinning such a wheel will have much the same meritorious effect as orally reciting the prayers.

[Thubten Zopa Rinpoche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thubten_Zopa_Rinpoche)  has commented that having a prayer wheel has the capacity to completely transform a place, which becomes "...peaceful, pleasant, and conducive to the mind." Simply touching a prayer wheel is said to bring great purification to negative karmas and obscurations.

His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, has said that having the mantra on your computer works the same as a traditional Mani wheel. So here comes open source 3d prayer wheel built with WebGL, ReactJS and physical based rendering.
